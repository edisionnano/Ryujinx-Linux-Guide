# Ryujinx Linux Guide
The purpose of this guide is to help your way arround using Linux and Ryujinx. The goal is to cover everything a user will need and then some. If you feel anything is missing or not explained enough feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Picking the distro
Linux isn't an operating system but rather a kernel (like NT is for Windows), the heart of an operating system (os) that developers use in order to create an operating system, Linux based operating systemw are called distributions or distros.
You may already have a working Linux installation but if you haven't you are probably wondering which distro suits you best out of the many that exist.
Since there are so many Linux distros, while Ryujinx strives to work everywhere it's a bit challenging to support them all so you should probably choose a more popular distribution like the ones discussed bellow.<br>
*Ubuntu<br>
*POP Os<br>
*Mint<br>
*Arch<br>
